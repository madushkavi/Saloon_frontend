# Saloon Booking Management System

Welcome to the Saloon Booking Management System project repository. This web application is designed to streamline and enhance the management of salon bookings.

## Project Overview

Our software team has developed a web application using React.js for the frontend and Laravel for the backend. The system is built to provide a more efficient and automated way of managing salon bookings, replacing the manual processes that can be time-consuming and error-prone.

## User Roles

The system supports two main user roles, each with specific permissions and access levels. Users are granted access to different parts of the system based on their roles.

- **Customer**: Customers can access the customer dashboard, allowing them to book appointments and manage their bookings.

- **Admin**: Admins have access to the admin dashboard, which includes features for managing salon services, appointments. The admin dashboard was expertly coded by [@Madushkavi](https://github.com/madushkavi).
